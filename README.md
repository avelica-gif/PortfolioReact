Creating a React Portfolio

In this project, I turned my basic portfolio to a basic React Portfolio. 

Links:

https://avelica-gif.github.io/PortfolioReact/

https://github.com/avelica-gif/PortfolioReact

Here is the original (pre-React) portofolio: https://avelicacodes.com/

Issues:

The routing of the webpages works perfectly locally, but does not work in the deployed version. 
I created a recorded that shows how to local host is working: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ih6Jmiszz4aInYvLz4Bogr8MeSKNPt6a/view

Future implementation: 

After the Boot Camp is over, I am planning to give this whole portfolio a face lift. I want to add more colors and the last project. I have not added any of the homeworks because I am not proud to add a single homework yet. At this point, it looks better with just the projects and deployed links turned in.

Thank you so much!
